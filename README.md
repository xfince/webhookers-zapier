# Student Inquiry Form

## Overview
The Student Inquiry Form is a web application that allows students to submit their inquiries through a simple and user-friendly interface. The form collects the student's name, email, and inquiry message, and sends this data to a server which then forwards it to a Zapier webhook for further processing.

## Current Features
- **User-friendly Form**: A clean and modern form for collecting student inquiries.
- **Server-Side Processing**: Handles form submissions on the server and sends data to a Zapier webhook.
- **Form Reset**: Automatically clears the form fields after successful submission.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Features
- **Form Validation**: Enhance form validation to provide instant feedback on user input.
- **Email Confirmation**: Send a confirmation email to the student upon successful submission.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Create an admin interface to manage and view submitted inquiries.
- **Analytics**: Add analytics to track form submissions and user interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Deployment**: Render
- **Others**: Zapier for webhook integration
